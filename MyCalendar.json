	"TaskDescription" : "<p>Calendar application is one of the most common and popular software used for scheduling meetings. You will write a console based Java program to implement some of the most basic features of a Calendar app.</p> <br> <ol> <li>A user can create a calendar with a title for the calendar.<br><br></li> <li>Create an appointment slot in the calendar. An appointment slot is created by the user to indicate availability for a meeting. For example: Iâ€™m available on Aug 28 at 9 AM for 30 minutes. An appointment slot is created by taking the date with time as one parameter and the duration in minutes as the second parameter.<br><br></li> <li>Only one appointment slot can be created for a specified time and duration. There cannot be two overlapping appointment slots. For example, if an appointment slot is created from Aug 28, 2015 at 9 AM for 30 minutes, the program should not allow the creation of another appointment slot at Aug 28, 2015 at 9:15 AM for 45 minutes.<br><br></li> <li>User can book an appointment by providing the date, time, duration, name of the person and the location. The appointment can only be booked if the given arguments exactly match the available appointment slot. For example: Ram wants to book an appointment on Aug 28, 2015 at 9 AM for 30 minutes in IIIT-H. This appointment will be booked successfully as there is an available slot. Another person Shyam wants to book an appointment on Aug 28, 2014 at 9:20 AM for 30 minutes in IIIT-H. This appointment cannot be booked because there is no available slot.<br><br></li> <li>Cancel an existing appointment by specifying the date and time.<br><br></li> <li>Print the schedule for a given day with the booked and available appointment slots.<br><br></li> </ol>",
